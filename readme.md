# How does the Internet Works
---
These are my notes taken while learning **how the internet works**. Here I have left everything that is **essential** for a software development student who wants to learn the internet concepts and applications necessary for web development.
The topics of these notes are:
* What is a network and how does it work?
* How is data sent to another device outside the local network?
* What protection does the internet and other types of networks have?
* How is communication on the internet organized?
* What are the layers of communication over the internet?
* What are protocols and why do we need them?
* What is the OSI model and TCP/IP model?
* Detailed guide (with everything you need to know) about each layer of the practical model (TCP/IP).
* Detailed guide (with everything you need to know) to the main protocols present in each layer.
